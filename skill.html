//Kick is the only method you may use. You may use math inside the Kick method.
//Variables X, Y, Z are the velocity vectors of where the user is pointing if they were to right click
//Each Kick MUST be on a separate line
//Every kick is separated by half a second
//This is a basic rainbow
//Kick(X, Y, Z); kicks toward the mouse.
Kick(X*0.4, 0.4, Z*0.4);
